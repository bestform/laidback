Model classes can persist themselves transparently using annotations for persistable attributes.
In the background, a couchdb instance is used to persist the objects.
In the future there might be support for other backends (FS, mongo, maybe even SQL-based datastores).

The project is currently in the idea-state. Meaning: no usable code, yet. Feel free to fork and contribute.
